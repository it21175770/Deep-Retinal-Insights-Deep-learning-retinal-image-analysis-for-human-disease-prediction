Overview

Deep Retinal Insights aims to revolutionize the early detection and management of retinal diseases. By analyzing retinal images, health records, and patient outcomes, the project focuses on providing accurate predictions of disease onset and progression. The goal is to enable early diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and a better understanding of disease progression over time. Through this integrated approach, Deep Retinal Insights seeks to improve patient care, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and ultimately contribute to more proactive and effective healthcare interventions.


Purpose

The Deep Retinal Insights project is developed to:

- Accurately classify retinal diseases through the analysis of retinal images, enabling early detection and diagnosis.
- Predict disease onset and progression by integrating patient health records and advanced predictive modeling.
- Provide personalized treatment recommendations based on patient responses and disease outcomes.
- Track disease progression over time to optimize treatment strategies and improve overall patient care.
